                    <strong> Extended Market Drivers of CIP Deviations In Korea’s Cross-Currency Swap Markets </strong> (with F.O. Olarewaju). [<a href="https://www.earticle.net/Article/A385560" target="_blank">Paper</a>]
               
			We explore the peculiar impact of critical indicators: dollar index, oil price, sovereign credit default swap (CDS), stock market returns, and Libor-OIS on the Korean won (KRW) 
			cross-currency basis (CCB) at the maturity of 1-and 5-years by segregating the timeframe into four periods: before the global financial crisis (GFC), during GFC, during eurozone crisis and after the crisis. 
			Regression with ARMA errors is employed to determine the impact of regressors on KRW as well as to deal with possible heteroskedasticity and serial correlation issues. 
			Vector autoregression (VAR) is used to obtain forecast error variance (FEV) decomposition to ascertain the dynamic relationship and predictive influence of these variables. 
			It is affirmed that CDS, stocks and Libor-OIS were most significant during GFC.

                    <strong> A New Testable Theory on Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity </strong> (R&R Journal of Derivatives). [<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4157839" target="_blank">Paper</a>]<br/>
                
			I propose an approximate closed-form model that captures the drivers of deviations from covered interest rate parity (CIP). The model relies on the assumption that a rational agent can
                        invest in a risky domestic bond (e.g., euro (EUR) bond) and in a risky foreign bond (e.g., dollar (USD) bond) hedged into EUR using cross-currency swaps, where
                        is the cross-currency basis swap spread that is associated with the FX hedging strategy and also measures the extent of CIP deviations, see Du et al. (2018). In the model, I show that  can be impacted by 3 drivers: 1) the
                        difference in credit spreads, 2) the difference in output due to technology, and 3) the difference in inflation. I analyse the theoretical predictions of
                        this model and perform a simple empirical analysis to validate these theoretical predictions. Finally, I discuss the empirical results and provide
                        recommendations for arbitrage opportunities in the fixed income and foreign exchange derivatives markets.

                    <strong> Financial Market Linkages in Crises: Evidence from Asia-Pacific and US </strong> (with G. Aipoh) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			It is well known that financial crises reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system, which worsens when markets are highly linked. 
			We study the linkages of financial markets amid major crisis periods like Covid 19 by examining the linkages and dynamics of the United States and eight Asia-pacific stock markets 
			(Japan, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore). Our main results are as follows: In the precrisis period, there were credible linkages between the markets as 
			confirmed by the presence of cointegrating relationships. However, the linkages between the US and Asia-pacific markets became much more evident and highly significant during and after most crisis periods. 
			The results suggest that US and Asia-pacific markets are strongly linked, with spillover influences that become particularly strong during crises.

			UIP and CIP theory holds true in certain economies, while it remains ineffective in others. The only difference here is time. Before the global financial crisis, 
			the theory held true but after that time, it has been rejected. It held true during certain monetary tightening and became ineffective after loosening of monetary policies.

                    <strong> Cross Currency Basis Swap Spread Spillover. </strong> (with N. Okafor) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			We investigate the relationship between the world’s major cross-currency bases between 2009 and 2020. 
			Particularly, we employ a VECM and impulse response functions to estimate and test for long-run linkages between the bases and 
			model how well shocks can be absorbed in the new equilibrium. We find that although cointegrating relationships do exist between the bases, 
			these equations are very weak and slow to correct themselves after a shock. However, we also find that European bases have been more resistant to shocks since 2015.

                    <strong> Hedging the Hedges – Can Gold Mitigate Basis Risk. </strong> (with N. Augustine and F. Olanrewaju) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			This paper examines the protective role of gold in the cross-currency swap market. 
			By taking the perspective of a dollar agent, we present novel empirical evidence into the investigation of gold as a hedge or haven against the marked-to-market risk 
			of using cross-currency basis swaps, otherwise known as basis risk, to hedge against exposure to foreign fixed income market in selected Asian and G-10 countries. 
			Following Baur & McDermott, (Journal of Banking and Finance 2010), we perform a GARCH based econometric analysis and find that gold is often a weak hedge, 
			weak safe haven and diversifier for the basis, implying that dollar agents with exposure to foreign bond markets via cross-currency swaps can to some extent 
			limit the risk of unfavourable basis movements (basis risk) by positioning in gold. We also present policy recommendations.

                    <strong> Dynamics of Oil Price and Currency Hedging. </strong> (with A. Adekanmbi and F. Olanrewaju) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			How does the cross-currency basis of a major oil-importing country, China, respond to changes in oil price when dealing with volatility and dynamic 
			fluctuations in global factors such as exchange rate and variations in banking and credit risks? This research intends to answer this question by adopting 
			Markov switching and threshold models coupled with standard impulse response and variance decomposition techniques. 
			Findings reveal that currency hedging intensifies alongside tighter dollar-yuan basis when oil prices increase, otherwise hedging activities reduce and 
			the basis widens, that is, inverse oil-basis relation in the low oil price regime. This indicates non-uniform and regime-dependent relationship between changes 
			in oil prices and the dollar-yuan basis where oil price changes have more importance for the basis.

                    <strong> Connectedness of G10 Cross-Currency Basis Swaps. </strong> (with G. Aipoh and F. Olanrewaju) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			This paper empirically examines how connected major cross-currency basis markets have become, which basis markets are the main giver of shocks to other markets and which ones are the main recipient of shocks from other markets. 
			To do this, we use Diebold-Yilmaz measure to examine the degree of connectedness of the G10 cross-currency basis swap spreads. 
			At all phases of connectedness considered, we document that EUR/USD basis is the most dominant net giver of shocks to other basis swaps and least recipient 
			of shocks from others whereas the USD bases for the following currencies: NZD, JPY, DKK, NOK, GBP, AUD, SEK and CAD show evidence of alternating between positive 
			and negative net connectedness values. We conclude that in the comity of G10 bases, the euro basis is the most important to track for the purposes of currency 
			risk management when hedging foreign exchange exposures using cross-currency swaps.

                    <strong> Twin Deficits versus Ricardian Hypothesis: Evidence from the World. </strong> (with Olanrewaju, F. and Lokossou, J.) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			Given the prevalent contentions regarding evidence for the twin deficits, twin divergence or Ricardian hypothesis across countries, 
			this paper empirically establishes which hypothesis has more support on a broader scale across a large panel of countries. 
			We find that the twin deficits hypothesis is more broadly supported for the whole panel of countries, and this is also true for the panel of OECD countries, 
			although to a lower extent. Accordingly, we highlight some policy implications of this outcome and provide recommendations for future studies.

                    <strong> The Effects of Financial Capital Flows on Domestic Investment: New Evidence. </strong> (with Thompson, O.) [Draft soon]<br/>
			
			Using 70 developing and 23 developed countries, this study examines the effect of capital inflows on domestic investment in host economies between 
			2000 and 2017 considering the high inflow of FDI since year 2000 especially into emerging economies. 
			The empirical results show that capital flows of FDI, portfolio investments and total capital flows have not actually increase domestic investment 
			in the host economies. Hence, policymakers in emerging economies should reduce emphasis of policies aim at increasing domestic investment from FDI and 
			portfolio investments.
