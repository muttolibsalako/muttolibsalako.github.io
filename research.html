                    <strong> Extended Market Drivers of CIP Deviations In Koreaâ€™s Cross-Currency Swap Markets </strong> (with F.O. Olarewaju). [<a href="https://www.earticle.net/Article/A385560" target="_blank">Paper</a>]
               
			We explore the peculiar impact of critical indicators: dollar index, oil price, sovereign credit default swap (CDS), stock market returns, and Libor-OIS on the Korean won (KRW) 
			cross-currency basis (CCB) at the maturity of 1-and 5-years by segregating the timeframe into four periods: before the global financial crisis (GFC), during GFC, during eurozone crisis and after the crisis. 
			Regression with ARMA errors is employed to determine the impact of regressors on KRW as well as to deal with possible heteroskedasticity and serial correlation issues. 
			Vector autoregression (VAR) is used to obtain forecast error variance (FEV) decomposition to ascertain the dynamic relationship and predictive influence of these variables. 
			It is affirmed that CDS, stocks and Libor-OIS were most significant during GFC.

                    <strong> A New Testable Theory on Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity </strong> (R&R Journal of Derivatives). [<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4157839" target="_blank">Paper</a>]
                
			I propose an approximate closed-form model that captures the drivers of deviations from covered interest rate parity (CIP). The model relies on the assumption that a rational agent can
                        invest in a risky domestic bond (e.g., euro (EUR) bond) and in a risky foreign bond (e.g., dollar (USD) bond) hedged into EUR using cross-currency swaps, where
                        is the cross-currency basis swap spread that is associated with the FX hedging strategy and also measures the extent of CIP deviations, see Du et al. (2018). In the model, I show that  can be impacted by 3 drivers: 1) the
                        difference in credit spreads, 2) the difference in output due to technology, and 3) the difference in inflation. I analyse the theoretical predictions of
                        this model and perform a simple empirical analysis to validate these theoretical predictions. Finally, I discuss the empirical results and provide
                        recommendations for arbitrage opportunities in the fixed income and foreign exchange derivatives markets.

                    <strong> Financial Market Linkages in Crises: Evidence from Asia-Pacific and US </strong> [Draft soon]
			
                </li>
			It is well known that financial crises reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system, which worsens when markets are highly linked. 
			We study the linkages of financial markets amid major crisis periods like Covid 19 by examining the linkages and dynamics of the United States and eight Asia-pacific stock markets 
			(Japan, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore). Our main results are as follows: In the precrisis period, there were credible linkages between the markets as 
			confirmed by the presence of cointegrating relationships. However, the linkages between the US and Asia-pacific markets became much more evident and highly significant during and after most crisis periods. 
			The results suggest that US and Asia-pacific markets are strongly linked, with spillover influences that become particularly strong during crises.
